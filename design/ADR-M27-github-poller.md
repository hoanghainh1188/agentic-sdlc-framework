## 1. Context

Task B06 reads GitHub events by polling (ADR-M11) and turns comment commands into gate decisions (FR-21). B05 built the adapter: `listEventsSince` returns the new events and the next cursor, and the caller stores the cursor (ADR-M23 §2.3). B03 built the shared gate command handler `decideGate` (ADR-M26 §2.4).

These points were open:

- how the worker schedules the polls, survives restarts and runs one poll per project at a time;
- how a crash between handling the events and saving the cursor is kept from applying an event twice;
- the command grammar, and where the `<reason>` text goes, because append-only tables hold no free text;
- how a comment is linked to an intent, and how the commenter is checked;
- how replies are posted, and in which language;
- how the worker is deployed.

## 2. Decision

### 2.1. A plain loop in the worker, no Temporal (D1)

- The worker runs a loop (`PollerLoop`, `platform/apps/worker/src/poller-loop.ts`).
  - Every tick (`SDLC_WORKER_TICK_MS`, default 1 s), it reads the pollable projects (`SystemScope.listPollableProjects()`) and starts the polls that are due.
  - Before every poll it reads the project's `github.poll_interval_seconds` (default 30) from the project configuration. A configuration change applies without a restart.
  - A project never has two polls running at once in one process. At most `SDLC_WORKER_MAX_CONCURRENT_POLLS` polls run at once (default 4).
  - After a `rate_limited` error, the project waits until GitHub's reset time (`retry_at`).
  - A project whose configuration cannot be read is skipped and tried again after 60 s. This is a technical retry delay, not a handbook rule.
- All state is in PostgreSQL: the cursor (`git_event_cursors`) and the receipts (`git_event_receipts`). After a restart, every project is polled once right away and continues from its stored cursor.
- `listPollableProjects()` crosses tenants, so it is a named system-scope method (ADR-M09 §2.4). It returns `tenantId`, `projectId` and the repository name of the active GitHub projects of active tenants, nothing else (tested). Everything after it runs in `forTenant(tenantId)`.
- Not chosen: one Temporal Schedule per project. It would write about 2,900 workflow runs per project per day into Temporal's history on a small server, and the interval would have to be synced with the configuration. B07 can still signal workflows from the loop.

### 2.2. One transaction, receipts, compare-and-set (D2)

`pollProject` (`@sdlc/core`, `git-events/poll-project.ts`) does one poll:

1. It reads the cursor and calls `listEventsSince`, outside any transaction.
2. In **one transaction**:
   - it moves the cursor first, with compare-and-set (`gitEventCursors.saveIfUnchanged`). When another poller moved it, the whole transaction rolls back (`cursor_moved`). The updated row stays locked until the commit, so a second poller waits and then fails the check.
   - it handles every event with `handleGitEvent` (`core/src/commands/git-event-handler.ts`). This is the one handler for polling now and webhooks later (ADR-M11).
3. After the commit, it posts the pending replies (§2.4).

- A crash before the commit applies nothing, and the next poll reads the same events again.
- The handler is also idempotent by `event.id`. Each command comment gets one receipt (`git_event_receipts`, D-05 §6.1b, migration 0006, unique per event). An event that already has a receipt is skipped, for example an item returned again in the overlap window, or the same comment through a webhook later.
- Each command runs inside a savepoint (`TenantScope.savepoint`). An expected refusal rolls back only that command:
  - `CommandError`;
  - `RegistryError`;
  - a stored value that the database refuses.
  The refusal is then recorded as a receipt with a reply.
- Any other error (for example a lost connection) rolls back the whole batch, and the next tick retries.
- Only command comments get a receipt. Other comments, reviews and checks only move the cursor: reviews and checks are read by later gates (E01, C08).

### 2.3. Command grammar and reason codes (D3)

```text
/approve G<n>
/reject G<n> [<reason_code>] <reason>
/request-changes G<n> [<reason_code>] <reason>
```

- Only the **first non-empty line** of a **newly created** comment counts. Edits are never events (QUESTIONS #43). Text quoted or written further down is never read as a command.
- The gate is `G1`–`G8`, in either case.
  - `/approve` takes nothing after the gate: `/approve G3 if the tests pass` is refused.
  - Gates other than G1–G3 are refused by `decideGate` (`gate_not_supported`); E01 and E03 add G7 and G8.
- `/reject` and `/request-changes` need a reason. The reason is the rest of the first line and the lines below.
  - An optional first word may be a code from `GATE_REASON_CODES` (`spec_unclear`, `spec-unclear`, any case).
  - Without a code, the platform records `other`.
- **The reason text stays in the comment on GitHub.** The decision stores `reason_code` and `reason_ref` = the comment's `https://` URL (ADR-M20). The parser returns codes only. Receipts and logs never hold text from GitHub.
- Other slash words (`/label`, later `/ack`, `/decide`, `/kill`) are not ours and are ignored. B11 and C11 add their verbs to the same parser.

### 2.4. Linking, permissions, replies

- **Link to an intent.** A comment on an issue matches `intents.issue_number`; a comment on a pull request matches `intents.pr_number`.
  - The match is limited to the polled project and to open intents (not `done`, `rejected` or `cancelled`).
  - 0 matches → reply `intent_not_linked`. More than 1 match → reply `intent_ambiguous` (QUESTIONS #68).
- **Actor.**
  - An actor with `type: 'bot'` is ignored without a reply. This includes the platform's own replies, so replies never loop (QUESTIONS #45).
  - Other actors are mapped through `user_identities` by the **numeric** account ID, never by the login.
  - An unknown account, a disabled user or an account linked only in another tenant → reply `user_not_linked`.
- **Permission and separation of duties.** `decideGate` runs with `source = github_comment` and `event_source = polling`. It applies the same checks as the API:
  - no role on the project → `intent_not_found`;
  - the input binding;
  - `Registry.decide` → policy `canApprove`: roles from the configuration, producers never approve, dual approval needs two different people.
- **Replies** (AC4) go only to commands that were refused or could not be read.
  - **A successful command gets no reply.** The gate status comment of B07 (FR-22) confirms it.
  - The receipt stores a reply code and code parameters (gate, refusal reason). The text is rendered from the message catalog when the reply is posted (`comment.reply.*`, NFR-08).
  - Syntax replies show the syntax and the list of valid reason codes.
  - Refusal texts come from `gate.reason.*`. These keys were `api.reason.*` before B06. The API uses the same keys, so both give the same sentence; a test checks that the API texts are unchanged.
- **Delivery.** Replies are posted after the commit, in event order, at least once.
  - A crash after the POST and before the update posts that reply again: a harmless duplicate.
  - A failed post is retried on the next polls. After `SDLC_WORKER_MAX_REPLY_ATTEMPTS` failures (default 5), the reply is given up and logged.
  - After a `rate_limited` answer, the other replies wait.

### 2.5. Deployment (D4)

- Compose service `sdlc-worker` in the profile `platform`.
  - Image `sdlc-worker:<version>`, built from `platform/apps/worker/Dockerfile`, user `node`.
  - Read-only root file system, `cap_drop: [ALL]`, `no-new-privileges`, no published port.
  - Its health check reads a heartbeat file that the loop writes every tick.
- The worker logs in to OpenBao with the AppRole `worker` and keeps the client open. The GitHub adapter reads the App key again every 10 minutes (ADR-M23 §2.2).
  - The database password is read once from `kv/worker/database` (field `password`).
  - `pnpm openbao:bootstrap worker-credentials` stores it and delivers the AppRole files. The same helper as `api-credentials` is used, so there is still only one `--cap-add` line.
- Settings `SDLC_WORKER_*`:

  | Setting | Default |
  |---|---|
  | `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_NAME` | `postgres`, `5432`, `platform` |
  | `DB_SECRET_PATH` | `worker/database` |
  | `GITHUB_API_URL` | `https://api.github.com` |
  | `TICK_MS` | `1000` |
  | `MAX_CONCURRENT_POLLS` | `4` |
  | `MAX_REPLY_ATTEMPTS` | `5` |
  | `HEARTBEAT_FILE` | `/tmp/sdlc-worker.heartbeat` |

  These are technical settings, not handbook rules.
- Dev mode `SDLC_WORKER_DEV_MODE=1` with `SDLC_WORKER_DEV_DB_URL` (`pnpm worker:start`) is refused when `NODE_ENV=production`.
  - The GitHub App key still comes only from OpenBao: production code never reads the key from a file or an environment variable (ADR-M23 §2.2).
  - OpenBao has no host port (A11), so on a development machine the worker runs in Compose (`pnpm compose:platform`).
- Logs are JSON lines with event codes and IDs, never comment text, tokens or keys. A08 replaces the logger.

### 2.6. Where the rules live

| Rule | Source |
|---|---|
| Who may decide each gate, oversight mode, dual approval, producers never approve | Config `oversight.*` through the policy engine (unchanged) |
| Approval expiry, working calendar | Config `oversight.approval_expiry`, `escalation.calendar` |
| Polling interval | Config `github.poll_interval_seconds` (default 30, D-02 §6.3) |
| Reason codes | `GATE_REASON_CODES` (ADR-M20), not configuration |
| Only new comments are events; numeric IDs; bots never decide | QUESTIONS #43, #45 (code) |
| Tick, concurrency, reply attempts | Worker settings (technical) |

### 2.7. Tests

- `pnpm test`:
  - the grammar (table of cases);
  - reply rendering and catalog keys;
  - the loop with a fake clock (interval per project from config, no overlap, config change, rate-limit reset, invalid configuration);
  - worker settings;
  - static Compose and bootstrap checks;
  - the API refusal texts unchanged.
- `pnpm test:db` (`git-poller.test.ts`), with the in-process GitHub stub:
  - AC1: a crash before the commit, a reply failure after the commit, a replayed event, two concurrent pollers, reply give-up;
  - AC2: the three commands;
  - AC3: numeric IDs, bots, roles, a disabled user, another tenant;
  - AC4: the replies;
  - no comment text in any table;
  - the receipt privileges and trigger;
  - `listPollableProjects` returns IDs only.
- Optional live test `platform/tests/integration/github/poller-live.test.ts`, with the test App and a throw-away database. It is **never run in CI**, and the owner runs it in a terminal. The App posts `/approve G9`; the poller records `ignored_bot`, no decision and no reply.

## 3. Risks

- **GitHub API rate limits grow with the number of polled projects.**
  - Each installation has 5,000 requests per hour. One project with 5 open pull requests at 30 s costs about 1,400 requests per hour (ADR-M23 §2.3). About three such projects on one installation reach the limit.
  - Mitigations:
    - most list calls are answered 304 (ETag), which GitHub does not count;
    - `github.poll_interval_seconds` can be raised per project;
    - after `rate_limited`, the project waits for the reset;
    - `git_host.rate_limit_low` is logged below 200 remaining.
  - Before more projects share one installation: measure, then raise the interval or move to webhooks (ADR-M11) once public infrastructure exists.
- `intents.issue_number` is not unique per project. Two open intents on one issue give `intent_ambiguous`, and nothing is decided (QUESTIONS #68).
- Replies are at least once, so a rare duplicate reply is possible. A successful command gets no reply until B07.
- One worker instance is the MVP. The compare-and-set makes a second instance safe, but not efficient: its polls roll back.

## 4. Consequences

- D-05 version 1.8: §6.1b `git_event_receipts`; `SDA06`.
- ADR-M09 0.6: `listPollableProjects()` in the system scope; `TenantScope.savepoint`.
- Catalog: `api.reason.*` renamed to `gate.reason.*`, with the same texts; new `comment.reply.*` and `worker.*` keys.
- B07 reuses the loop to signal workflows and posts the gate status comment (FR-22). B11 adds `/ack` and `/decide`; C11 adds `/kill`; E01 adds G7 through reviews.
- Runbook T11: §5b.1 (test App key in the development OpenBao) and §5f (worker credentials). Handbook Ch.19: usage of the comment commands.
