This register lists every rule of the root `CLAUDE.md` and the check that enforces it today. Use it to find the rules that are only text, and to decide where a rule belongs (ADR-M84).

- **ID**: `R` + the number of the bullet in the root `CLAUDE.md` on 2026-10-20 (R001–R131; later rules from R132), with a letter when one bullet holds several rules. Bullets that only hold commands, reading lists, decisions or the layout (R001–R012, R017–R023, R097–R120, R128–R131) are not listed. IDs never change and are never reused; a removed rule keeps its row with the proposal `removed`.
- **Kind**: lint · test · db (trigger, grant, constraint in a migration) · runtime (guard code) · ci · hook-candidate · text-only · INFO.
- **Enforced by**: the file and line of the check. Paths that start with `tests/`, `packages/` or `apps/` are under `platform/`; `migrations/` is `platform/packages/core/src/db/migrations/`.
- **Coverage**: full (a change that breaks the rule fails a check) · partial (some cases only) · none.
- **File**: the `CLAUDE.md` that holds the rule, tagged at the end of its bullet with its ID (`[R043]`). `platform/tests/workspace/claude-md.test.ts` checks that every ID is in exactly that file, once (W01 PR 4).
- **Proposal**: keep-root (stays in the root `CLAUDE.md`) · move:<folder> (goes to a `CLAUDE.md` in that folder, W01 PR 4) · pointer-only (enforced; `CLAUDE.md` needs one short line only) · add-lint · add-test · add-hook (W01 PR 2–3) · drop-or-move-to-doc.
- A new rule in `CLAUDE.md` gets a row here in the same pull request.

## 5. Open points

- R067a: no code reads LiteLLM's status today; the runner reads the key's spend (ADR-M24 §2.2). The rule stays for any code that reads the status later.
- R060b: the rule is about the logins mentioned in notice comments (ADR-M28, ADR-M30). The login of an admin identity (`user_identities.external_login`, ADR-M37) is a different case. The wording in `CLAUDE.md` now says so.
- R085b ("before U07") and R123, R126, R127 hold dates or task names and will become wrong; W01 PR 4 moves them out of the root `CLAUDE.md`.
- Same rule twice: R067b and R071b (money as a decimal string); R044c and R053g (plain loops, never Temporal schedules). PR 4 keeps one line each.
