## A–C

| Term | Meaning in this handbook | Japanese (reference) |
|---|---|---|
| **Acceptance criteria** ◆ | Testable conditions that decide whether a requirement is met. On the platform, G2 counts them in the linked spec (for example under a heading `## 受入基準 / Acceptance criteria`) and passes only with at least one | 受入基準 |
| **ADR (Architecture Decision Record)** | A short record of a significant design decision, the options considered and why one was chosen (template T12) | アーキテクチャ決定記録 (ADR) |
| **Agent (AI agent)** | An AI assistant that can carry out several steps by itself: read, plan, change code, run tests. In this handbook: a tool + a model + instructions + permissions + context sources (Chapter 20) | AIエージェント |
| **Agent branch** ◆ | The branch `agent/INT-…` of one intent. The runner (never the agent) pushes the checked changes there after G5; the pull request comes from it | エージェントブランチ |
| **Agent register** | The list of all agents in use, with owner, version, permissions and status | エージェント台帳 |
| **Agent run** ◆ | One execution of an agent for one intent, from start to stop | エージェント実行 |
| **API token** ◆ | A personal key (`sdlc_pat_…`) to use the `sdlc` command and the dashboard. Valid 90 days by default; never put it in a chat, a ticket or a command line. Different from a model token | APIトークン |
| **AppRole** ◆ | OpenBao's login for a machine process (api, worker, runner…): a fixed role ID plus a secret ID that expires after 90 days. Delivered by the `pnpm openbao:bootstrap <process>-credentials` commands (runbook T11 §5c) | AppRole |
| **Approval** | A decision by a person with authority to let work continue, bound to an exact version | 承認 |
| **Artifact** | Anything produced during the work: a spec, a design, code, a test report, a release package | 成果物 |
| **Audit log** | An append-only record of who (or what) did what, when, and on which evidence. Kept at least 2 years | 監査ログ |
| **Autonomy level** | What an agent is allowed to do (L0–L4) | 自律レベル |
| **Backup owner** ◆ | The person who receives an escalation when its escalation owner does not acknowledge it in time; after the backup owner, governance (Chapter 6) | 代理担当者 |
| **Blast radius** | How much can be affected if something goes wrong | 影響範囲 |
| **Block window** ◆ | After the platform passes a HOTL gate by itself, the time in which a person with the gate's role can still reject it or ask for changes. 4 working hours by default, configurable. No agent run starts while a block window is open | 差し止め可能期間 |
| **Break-glass** | Emergency access outside normal rules: short, limited, approved by a second person, always reviewed (Chapter 6) | 緊急時特権アクセス |
| **BrSE (Bridge System Engineer)** | The engineer who connects the Japanese client and the Vietnamese team | ブリッジSE |
| **Budget (token budget)** ◆ | The maximum AI usage cost allowed for a client, an intent or a run | 予算（トークン予算） |
| **Change flag** ◆ | A label in the plan for a sensitive kind of change: `migration`, `breaking_contract`, `payment`, `personal_data`… Some make G3 a human decision at any risk; some make G7 need two approvals | 変更フラグ |
| **Client data** | Anything a client gives us or that we create for a client | 顧客データ |
| **Comment command** ◆ | A command on the first line of a new comment on the intent's issue or pull request, such as `/approve G3`, `/ack ESC-…` or `/kill`. Editing a comment never changes a decision | コメントコマンド |
| **Containment** | Stopping the damage from spreading: stop traffic, isolate, keep a safe state | 封じ込め |
| **Context** | The information an agent reads to do a task: code, documents, specs | コンテキスト |

## D–H

| **Data class** | The sensitivity label that decides where information may go: `public`, `internal`, `client_confidential`, `client_restricted`, `prohibited` (Chapter 2) | データ分類 |
| **Decision packet** | The information a reviewer needs to decide: intent, risk, scope, diff, evidence, cost, rollback plan, agent recommendation | 判断資料 |

| **Escalation** | Handing a decision to a person with independent authority (Chapter 6) | エスカレーション |
| **Escalation code** ◆ | The code of an escalation, such as `ESC-2026-0012`. Each escalation has two clocks from the SLA table (Chapter 6 §6.4): the **acknowledge** clock (someone says "I have it") and the **resolve** clock (someone decides) | エスカレーション番号 |
| **Escalation owner** ◆ | The person who receives an escalation first, chosen by its type (intent, technical, security, policy). Never a producer of the change | エスカレーション担当者 |

| **Gate** ◆ | A decision point that allows, blocks, pauses or escalates work (G1–G8). Different from a step, which does work (Chapter 10). Short names in the guides and the dashboard: G1 Intent, scope, risk · G2 Specification · G3 Plan · G4 Execution boundary · G5 Scope and budget · G6 Verification · G7 Review and merge · G8 Release | ゲート（関門） |

| **Guardrail** | A rule enforced by the system that keeps an agent within safe limits | ガードレール |
| **Hallucination** | AI output that looks right but is invented or wrong | ハルシネーション |

| **PQC (production-qualified change)** | A change that passed all gates, needed no major rework, and caused no problem during the observation window (Chapter 8) | 本番適格変更 |
| **Producer** ◆ | Anyone who produced a change: the intent's creator, the plan's submitter, the person who allowed a run, the authors of its commits, and the agent. A producer never approves that change at G7 or G8 (the commit authors count at G7 only; the platform's list: [Chapter 15 §15.10.1](../02-playbook/ch15-p5-release.md#producers)) | 作成者 |

| **Pull request (PR)** | A request to merge changes into a protected branch, reviewed at G7 | プルリクエスト |

## R–Z

| Term | Meaning in this handbook | Japanese (reference) |
|---|---|---|
| **2+N team** | Two people in control plus N AI agents (Chapter 5) | 2+N体制 |

| **Run Contract** ◆ | The platform's signed permission for one agent run: scope, tools, budget, expiry | 実行契約 |
| **Sandbox** | An isolated environment where an agent can work without affecting real systems | サンドボックス |
| **Secret ID** ◆ | The part of an AppRole login that expires (90 days); rotated with the credentials commands and never written to a log or a chat | シークレット ID |
| **Second approver** ◆ | A person with the project role `second_approver`: the second approval at G7 for flagged changes and at Critical risk, and at G8 at Critical risk | 第二承認者 |
| **Separation of duties** | The person or agent that produced something never approves it | 職務分掌 |
| **Sidecar** | A helper container that runs next to a service; `litellm-agent` is the sidecar that gives LiteLLM its keys from OpenBao | サイドカー |
| **Specification (spec)** | The testable description of what to build (Chapter 11) | 仕様書 |
| **Sprint 0** | A setup sprint before feature work, to prepare people, rules and agents (Chapter 10) | スプリント0 |

| **Task plan** | The breakdown of work for agents: files, tools, budget, done criteria, escalation rules (template T13) | タスク計画 |
| **Tenant** ◆ | A client or a unit with its own data on the platform. Every record belongs to one tenant, and nobody sees another tenant's data | テナント |
