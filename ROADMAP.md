# Roadmap

Generated from the backlog (`scripts/generate-backlog.py`, the same source as [design/D-08](design/D-08-mvp-backlog.md)); do not edit by hand. The platform grows release by release; **v0.1.0 is the baseline**: the whole G1–G8 flow with evidence, audit and token cost ([what it includes](design/MVP-DONE.md)). Each task gets its own plan before it is built, so the order can change. Ideas and questions: [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/hoanghainh1188/agentic-sdlc-framework/discussions).

| Milestone | Goal |
|---|---|
| M-E | The trial, run by the community (QUESTIONS #340) |
| UX | Friendlier for users and deployers: v0.1.1, v0.2.0, then v0.3.0 with the agent measures and `sdlc help`; V17 in v0.8.0 (QUESTIONS #355, #364, #420, #424) |
| DEV | Rules as checks for contributors and Claude Code: a rules register, hooks, lint and tests (QUESTIONS #479) |
| EVAL | Evaluation for managers: they plan evaluations, get reports and recommendations to improve agents, prompts and models; on the server and on developer machines. After v0.3.0, before EXT (QUESTIONS #450) |
| EXT | Other Git hosts first, then other agents, tools for agents, document knowledge: v0.6.0, X12 in v0.7.0 (QUESTIONS #361, #420, #424; v0.5.0 has the X09 spike) |
| Models | Self-hosted models: L01 PR 1 and L03 in v0.6.0; then L01 PR 2 and the L03b measurement (QUESTIONS #362, #424) |
| Server | A team on a server: v0.7.0 with O01, O02, H04, H05, V15; v0.8.0 with H02, H03, V16; toward v1.0 (QUESTIONS #363) |
| Later | Not scheduled yet (was "MVP+1"; U01–U03 were started early there and are done; U07 and U08 are done in v0.8.0) |
| M-F | Adjust gates, budgets and rules from the trial data, then a trial on a real internal tool (D-02 §13.3) |
