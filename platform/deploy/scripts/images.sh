# Published or locally built platform images (task V04, design/ADR-M66; ADR-M94 §2.4, task V15).
#
# Usage: platform/deploy/scripts/images.sh mode        # prints `published` or `local`
#        platform/deploy/scripts/images.sh get <NAME>  # prints SDLC_IMAGE_<NAME> of the lock file
#        platform/deploy/scripts/images.sh export      # prints the lock file's NAME=value lines
#        platform/deploy/scripts/images.sh verify      # cosign and gh check of the six images
#
# `published` only on a release checkout: a Git checkout whose HEAD is exactly the tag
# v<version of the root package.json>, with no change to a tracked file. Everything else (main, a
# branch, a changed file, a source archive) builds the images locally.
#
# The lock file of a release is an asset of its GitHub Release (an immutable release: the asset
# never changes). The tagged commit holds no lock file. The script reads, in this order:
#   1. the file named by SDLC_IMAGES_LOCK (a server without access to github.com);
#   2. platform/deploy/.images/vX.Y.Z.lock (ignored by Git), downloaded once over HTTPS from
#      https://github.com/hoanghainh1188/governed-adlc-fw/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/images.lock
#      (a public repository: no token).
# Every lock file must be complete: SDLC_IMAGES_VERSION equal to the root package.json and the six
# images pinned by digest on the one registry path. On a release checkout a lock file that is
# missing or not complete stops the script with an error: it never builds silently instead.
# Tags v0.6.0 and before hold their lock file in the commit and keep their own copy of this script.
#
# Environment:
#   SDLC_IMAGES       `published` or `local` overrides the choice; `published` is the way to use
#                     the images of a release's source archive
#   SDLC_IMAGES_LOCK  the lock file to use instead of the download
