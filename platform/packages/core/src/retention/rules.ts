// selection in the database is the first filter, these rules decide again for every row, and the
// purge decides a third time under the intent lock, with the time of that moment.
//
// - One clock per intent: its evidence is kept `retention days` after the later of the intent's
//   end and the row's creation. Open intents are never purged.
// - A code minimum that no configuration changes: nothing younger than 180 days, from its creation
//   and from its intent's end, is purged for retention (`MIN_EVIDENCE_AGE_DAYS`). It equals the
//   floor of rule M31 and the bucket's default lock.
// - Held intents are never purged.
// - An archived project: after the archive grace period (from `project.archived`), every finished
//   intent's evidence is purged, also before the 180 days: the purge identity then bypasses the
//   GOVERNANCE lock (FR-44).
