// what reaches the sandbox. Only the last rule differs between adapters (`finishRule`).
//
// - The spec is not copied: the agent reads it from the workspace, cloned at `base_sha`.
// - After a request for changes at G7 (E01 PR 2), the reviewer's feedback sits in a block delimited
//   by markers with a random nonce, framed as untrusted data that cannot change the task, the
//   rules, the files or the tools (G5 and the contract enforce those whatever the text says).
// - For a plan read from a file (B09 PR 2, ADR-M40 §2.7), the tasks' text sits in a block of its
//   own, with its own nonce, framed the same way.
