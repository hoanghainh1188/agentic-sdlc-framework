// Agent adapter interface (design/D-03 section 7.2, D-08 C05, design/ADR-M29). The MVP
// implementation is `@sdlc/adapter-agent-openhands` (OpenHands Agent Server over REST, ADR-M04,
// ADR-M10). The runner depends on this interface; the agent runs inside the run's sandbox.
//
// Rules the interface carries:
// - The agent talks to models only through LiteLLM with the run's virtual key (FR-50). The key is
//   passed through the Agent Server API, never as a sandbox environment variable (ADR-M25 §2.4).
// - The model is chosen by the platform, never by the agent: it must be one of the contract's
//   `allowed_models` (D-07 §4, QUESTIONS #79).
// - Caps come from the Run Contract (FR-32): `max_iterations` is enforced by the agent itself,
//   `max_duration_min` by the caller (interrupt, then remove the sandbox).
// - Commits: the platform commits what the agent left, with a fixed author that names the agent,
//   so G7 counts the agent as a producer (FR-11, QUESTIONS #80).
