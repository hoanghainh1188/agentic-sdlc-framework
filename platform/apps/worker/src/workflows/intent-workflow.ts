// The intent workflow on Temporal (D-08 B07 AC1 and AC5, design/D-03 section 6, ADR-M30; the run
// after G4: D-08 C06 AC4, ADR-M33 §2.6).
//
// A thin durable loop. The database is the source of truth: the `stepIntent` activity reads the
// intent under its lock and makes at most one move (core `stepIntent`). The workflow steps again
// after a move, waits for a wake signal when there is nothing to do, and ends when the intent is
// finished. It holds no client data: its input, signal and activity results are IDs and codes.
//
// C06 session 2: when G4 is decided the step asks for a run (`run_prepare`). The workflow prepares
// it (`prepareRun`, worker), hands it to the runner (`executeRun` on the task queue `sdlc-runner`:
// one long-running activity with heartbeats, one attempt), and asks the step again. When the run
// ended the step says `run_ended` and the workflow calls `finishRun`. A lost runner (heartbeat
// timeout, activity failure) → `abandonRun`: the run's key is revoked at once and the run fails.
// Old histories never saw the run outcomes, so the new branches replay them unchanged (no patch).
//
// C08 (ADR-M38 §2.1): when G5 passed a run and its block window closed, the step says `publish`.
// `push`: `preparePublish` (worker: a single-repository `contents: write` token, wrapped), then
// `publishRun` on the runner's queue (one attempt, heartbeats), then `finishPublish` (worker: the
// pull request). `open_pr`: `finishPublish` only. A lost runner counts as a failed attempt
// (`abandonPublish`); a failed push waits `RUN_ACTIVITY_RETRY_MS` before the step is asked again.
//
// C11 (ADR-M42 §2.2): the kill switch records the kill in the database first, then sends the
// `kill` signal. While `executeRun` is pending (waiting for a runner slot, or running), the signal
// cancels it: an activity that has not started never starts, and a running one gets the cancel on
// its next heartbeat (the runner also sees `stopping` in the database within a poll). The workflow
// first asks the worker to revoke the run's key (`revokeKilledRunKey`), then waits until the
// runner has stopped the agent and cleaned up (`WAIT_CANCELLATION_COMPLETED`). A kill signal at
// any other time changes nothing. Old histories never saw the signal and replay unchanged.
//
// Deterministic code only: this file is bundled for the Temporal workflow sandbox and may import
// `@temporalio/workflow`, `@sdlc/contracts` and types (lint rule in eslint.config.mjs).
// The escalation clocks are not timers here (ADR-M28): the workflow asks the database. The only
// timers are the one a step asks for (`wakeInMs`) and the pause after a failed activity.
