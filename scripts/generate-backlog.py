## 1. Purpose

- Split the platform's work into **small tasks, each fitting one Claude Code session**, release after release (v0.1.0 is the baseline; QUESTIONS #360).
- Each task has: dependencies, related requirements (FR/NFR), code area, **acceptance criteria**.
- Serves as the list for GitHub issues and assignments.

## 2. Conventions

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ID | `A` = M-A, `B` = M-B, `R` = M-0 (sample repo), `C` = M-C, `E` = M-D (`E` avoids confusion with document codes `D-xx`), `U` = user interface (MVP+1, started early), `S` = spec tools and `K` = document knowledge (before the trial M-E), `V` = the trial M-E (validation by the community) and its usability round UX, `X` = extensions (agents, tools, knowledge, Git hosts), `L` = models, `O` = operations on a server, `H` = hardening (security and data) |
| Size | **S** ≈ 1 session · **M** ≈ 1–2 sessions · **L** ≈ split into 2–3 sessions. [Proposal] Relative estimate, not person-hours |
| Depends on | Tasks that must be finished first |
| Acceptance criteria | Conditions for the PR to be approved. Claude Code writes tests for them |

[Proposal] No dates or assignees here. Assignment and deadlines are decided by Harry.

```

- M-0 lives in a **separate repo** (`pilot-order-inventory`). Done at the end of M-B, before C09.
- C01 (OpenHands PoC) can start early, right after A02, to reduce risk.

### Critical path (longest chain) [Proposal]

`{CP}`

- Computed from dependencies and task size (S=1, M=2, L=3). To finish sooner: prioritise tasks on this path and run the others in parallel.

## 5. Handing tasks to Claude Code

### 5.1. Rules for each session [Proposal]

1. **One session = one task** (L tasks are split into 2–3 sessions).
2. Claude Code **reads the task and related docs**, then **proposes a plan**: files to change, tests to add. A human approves the plan before coding.
3. Only change files in the approved plan. Need more → stop and ask.
4. Run lint + tests. Open a PR using template T2, with the task ID (e.g. `A07`).
5. If a design doc is **missing or contradictory** → do not guess. Add the question to `design/QUESTIONS.md` and stop.
6. New technical decisions (library choice…) → write a short ADR in `design/`.

### 5.2. Session opening prompt

```text
Task: A07 — Append-only audit log + hash chain
Read: design/D-08 (task A07), design/D-05 section 7, CLAUDE.md.
Step 1: propose a plan (files to create/change, tests to write, risks). Do not code yet.
Step 2: after I approve, code + tests matching acceptance criteria AC1–AC4.
Step 3: run lint + tests, summarise the results, open a PR with the T2 template.
If a doc is missing or contradictory: add the question to design/QUESTIONS.md and stop.
```

### 5.3. Creating GitHub issues from the CSV

- `D-08-backlog.csv` columns: `id, milestone, title, size, depends_on, requirements, area, acceptance_criteria, note`.
- Use `scripts/create-issues.py` (see `platform/GETTING-STARTED.md`): creates milestones, labels and issues; supports `--dry-run`; never creates duplicates.

---

## 6. Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| A task is bigger than one session; Claude Code leaves it half done | Split as noted. Re-assess sizes after M-A |
| The OpenHands Agent Server does not behave as expected | Do C01 early. If it fails → reconsider the agent (the interface allows replacing it) |
| Gaps in the design docs | `design/QUESTIONS.md` + review after every milestone |
| Size estimates are wrong | Record actual time per task; adjust for the next milestone |

Generated from the backlog (`scripts/generate-backlog.py`, the same source as [design/D-08](design/D-08-mvp-backlog.md)); do not edit by hand. The platform grows release by release; **v0.1.0 is the baseline**: the whole G1–G8 flow with evidence, audit and token cost ([what it includes](design/MVP-DONE.md)). Each task gets its own plan before it is built, so the order can change. Ideas and questions: [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/hoanghainh1188/agentic-sdlc-framework/discussions).
